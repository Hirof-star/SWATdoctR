`SWATdoctR` is a collection of functions and routines for SWAT model calibration and model diagnostics. The R package includes routines for a guided model setup verification, as well as functions for the visualization and diagnosis of simulation outputs. The aim of the `SWATdoctR` is to identify potential issues in the model setup early in the calibration process and to support the SWAT modeler to focus on a plausible process representation in the model calibration process. Additionally, package is intended to be used as SWAT+ models quality assurance tool in order to increase confidence level in model results and applications. A detailed overview is presented in the article by @plunge2024a.

Most functions were developed for the implementation of modeling tasks in the [OPTAIN project](https://www.optain.eu/). These tools are intended to fill the gaps in the SWAT+ workflow alongside the main tools developed by [Christoph Schuerz](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=49467). Therefore, we highly recommend trying and using these tools:

- [SWATprepR](https://biopsichas.github.io/SWATprepR/) - SWAT+ model input data preparation helper. The package is presented in the article @plunge2024b;
- [SWATbuildR](https://github.com/chrisschuerz/SWATbuildR) - R tool for building SWAT+ setups.
- [SWATfarmR](http://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATfarmR/) - R tool for preparing management schedules for the SWAT model.
- [SWATrunR](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATrunR/) - R tool for running 
SWAT models for different parameters and scenarios. Please install branch names *remove_legacy*. It could be done using line like this `remotes::install_github("chrisschuerz/SWATrunR@remove_legacy")`
- [SWATtunR](https://biopsichas.github.io/SWATtunR/) - R tool for soft & hard calibration, validation of SWAT+ models.
- [SWATmeasR](https://git.ufz.de/schuerz/swatmeasr) - R tool for implementing Natural/Small Water Retention Measures (NSWRMs) in the SWAT+ models and running scenarios.

Additionally, we recommend checking out the following packages, which can be used to build scripted workflows for SWAT+:

- [SWATreadR](https://github.com/chrisschuerz/SWATreadR) - Read and write SWAT+ input and output files.
- [SWATdata](https://github.com/chrisschuerz/SWATdata) - SWAT project datasets for SWATrunR and SWATfarmR.

Detailed information about packages, workflow steps, input data, SWAT+ parameters, model calibration, validation, etc., could be found in the [SWAT+ modeling protocol](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7463395) @optain2022.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **SWATdoctR** from [GitHub](https://github.com/biopsichas/SWATdoctR/).

``` r
# If the package 'remotes' is not installed run first:
install.packages("remotes")

# The installation of `SWATprepR`.
remotes::install_github("biopsichas/SWATdoctR")
```

## Getting started

To get started with `SWATdoctR`, please refer to the vignettes available at: [https://biopsichas.github.io/SWATdoctR/](https://biopsichas.github.io/SWATdoctR/docs/articles/qa.html).
